# 3D Diorama
- Unity 2021.3.18f1  
- Blender 3.4.3
  
### The Idea
- Need a thing to experiment with shaders and texture.
- Need a thing to tangibly experience blender to unity workflow
- Creating a waterfall scene. very basic, very low poly close to 90s era playstation graphics
  
### Motivation:
- figure out how many polys is unity comfortable with
when exporting from blender.  
- how to manage scale of scene and models, imported or otherwise
- texture blending, normals, outdoor lighting
- billboarding and gpu instancing?
